    游닉 Welcome to the Risk To Reward Calculator App! 游닉
    
    This tool will:
      - Fetch historical price data from Binance.
      - Detect the last higher high from the data.
      - Calculate the risk-to-reward ratio based on your trade parameters and the last higher high.
    
    Instructions:
      1. Ensure you have entered the proper trading pair, interval, and limit.
      2. If you provide a pair with no other data, the app will provide only the most recent higher high
      3. It calculates a take profit target at a given percentage above the entry,
         and an expected bottom based on the detected higher high.
      4. Please provide the following details in a single line, separated by spaces:
        4.1. Trading pair(e.g., BTCUSDT, ETHUSDC)
        4.2. Entry price(e.g., 2543.25, 7.26, 0.54)
        4.3. Take Profit(TP) percentage(e.g., 25 for 25%)
        4.4. Expected further drop(if you entered 30% down and expect another 10%, enter 40)
        
        Example input: ETHUSDT 2543.25 25 40
        Meaning you entered ETHUSDT at $2543.25, set a TP at 25%, and expected it drop 40% in total from the last higher high
        
    Let's begin!
