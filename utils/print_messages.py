    ðŸ“¢ Welcome to the Risk-To-Reward Calculator CLI! ðŸ“¢
    
    This tool fetches historical price data from Binance, identifies the last higher high, 
    and calculates the risk-to-reward ratio based on your input parameters.
    
    You can use three different input modes:
    
      1. **Only Trading Pair Provided**
         - **Input:** <Trading Pair>
         - **Returns:** 
             â€¢ The last higher high 
             â€¢ The most recent lower low (price after the last higher high)
      
      2. **Trading Pair, Entry Price, and Take Profit (TP) Percentage Provided**
         - **Input:** <Trading Pair> <Entry Price> <TP Percentage>
         - **Returns:** 
             â€¢ The take profit target price (calculated from the entry price and TP percentage)
             â€¢ The expected bottom (based on the detected higher high)
             â€¢ The risk (using the actual drop from the last lower low)
             â€¢ The reward
             â€¢ The risk-to-reward (R/R) ratio
       
      3. **Trading Pair, Entry Price, TP Percentage, and Anticipated Drop Percentage Provided**
         - **Input:** <Trading Pair> <Entry Price> <TP Percentage> <Anticipated Drop Percentage>
         - **Returns:** 
             â€¢ The take profit target price
             â€¢ The expected bottom
             â€¢ The risk (calculated based on the anticipated drop provided by you)
             â€¢ The reward
             â€¢ The risk-to-reward (R/R) ratio
    
    **Example Input:**
    
       ETHUSDT 2543.25 25 40
    
    This means:
       - Trading Pair: ETHUSDT
       - Entry Price: $2543.25
       - Take Profit at: 25%
       - Anticipated total drop: 40% from the last higher high
